First, we produced descriptive statistics for the prevalence of being bullied at seven years old according to household income quintiles when the child was 9 months old, based on data meeting our inclusion criteria. Secondly, we undertook a univariable analysis to explore and assess the strength of association between household income (exposure) and child-reported being bullied (outcome) with all the early life risk factors as listed above. We did this by estimating relative risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by Poisson regression. We considered factors as potential mediators for our third analysis stage, based on their significance level in the univariable analysis, calculated using the likelihood ratio test (<i>p =</i> ≤0.1). Thirdly, we conducted a complete case multivariable analysis adding our potential mediators grouped into the three domains most commonly reported: factors influencing the child’s social networks, the child’s family relationships and also the individual child’s abilities and behaviours. We used the World Health Organisation’s ‘stepwise approach’ for tackling social inequalities which seeks to reduce the gap between most advantaged and most disadvantaged.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6541267/#pone.0217162.ref033" rev="en_rl_none" class="en-link"><span style="--darkmode-color: rgb(214, 238, 253); --lightmode-color: rgb(6, 85, 136);" class="UrtAp">33</span></a>] Applied to our analysis, we assessed the change to the SEC gap, by comparing the risk for children in the lowest income quintile with the highest, from a sex and ethnicity adjusted baseline.
